# Requirement #2 

- The VM/server and other infrastructural resources must be created using Terraform
- Infra creation can be done by invoking Terraform commands locally

Please see the hcl scripts in [terraform](terraform) folders.

Managed to use terraform to setup the ec2 at AWS and use ansible scripts to install docker engine after it has been set up.

The terraform HCL script automatically output the inventory.ini file for ansbile consumption.

Also, as I could not find suitable ansible github actions at the marketplace, I wrote my ansible github actions. Please see [.github/actions](.github/actions) folder.

# Bonus Requirement

- The application is served over HTTPS
- Get a domain
- Generate Letâ€™s Encrypt certificates
- Point the domain to your server

Manually set up a reverse-proxy server using HAProxy with loadbalancing and https using letsencrypt certificate.
